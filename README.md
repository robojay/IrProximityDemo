# IR Proximity Demo

This explains how to use a modulated infrared LED and IR detector
module for simple proximity sensing.

The PDF and related Arduino code were part of a presentation to the
Nashua Robot Builders.  The PDF was meant as a supplement to the 
talk, so some of the pages may seem sparse.

Requires Timer One library (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerOne).

## This work is thrown into the wild.

If you decide to experiment with this library anyways, feel free to report issues, etc., but don't expect any level of support.

Thanks for your understanding!
